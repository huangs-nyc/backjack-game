# Blackjack Game
 
Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Fully functional with a dealer
table to play against. All buttons are functional. More advanced than previous
projects, such as the rock, paper, scissors game.

Instructions: Press "Start Game" to start the game. You will be presented
with two cards, and the total value of your hand. You may see one of the
dealer's cards, but not their whole hand. Click "Hit" to draw additional cards,
and "Hold" if you want to keep your current hand. If the dealer draws addtional
cards, you will be able to see them. If your hand value exceeds 21, then you will
lose, regardless of the hand of the dealer. If it is equal to 21, then you will
have a Blackjack hand; a tie with the dealer if they also Blackjack, or an automatic
win otherwise. If you have less than 21, then whoever has the higher value, granted that
the dealer has a hand less than or equal to 21 wins. You may bet money, $50 at a time. If
you win, then the amount with be returned to you, along with the additional bet amount
as winnings. If you tie, then the bet amount is simply returned to you. If you lose,
then you lose your bet amount. You can play until you run out of money.

Notable additions compared to previous projects:  
1. More advanced game logic
2. More advanced button animations
3. Resetting and adding to a display after each round
4. Keeping track of a running balance
5. Much more code (haha!)
